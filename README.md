A program created entirely (or mostly) with AI, I'm archiving it because I don't see the point of it, and realistically, I want to dedicate my time to other things I really like. I'm not a programmer, or not one who really knows Python or any other language used in this program. I'm sorry for pretending to be one. Sorry, it's a curious project that demonstrates the capabilities of current AI but also a pure example of its limits.

I tried to do my best, but AI is very limiting, and I don't think it's really a replacement for programmers.

Forever a GNU/Linux user ♥️.

# Zen Browser Start (Zen Browser Installer AppImage)
This program, written in Python, allows you to manage the Zen Browser AppImage through a graphical interface and integrates with the Linux desktop. (Compatible with Gnome, KDE Plasma, etc.)

Features:
- Always update Zen Browser every time you start it if a new version is available.
- Complete uninstallation of the AppImage and its remnants without deleting user data.
- Fewer clicks to install the amazing Zen Browser without depending on outdated packages or flatpak packages (which consume more resources than AppImage).

You can use the "python3 zen-browser-start" command after cloning the repository into the cloned folder, or you can use the pre-compiled binary at https://github.com/krafairus/zen-browser-start/releases.

WARNING!
This program is not affiliated with the [Zen Team](https://zen-browser.app/about/), nor do we own the logos or trademarks used for this program. All rights belong to their respective owners. It works, but it has a problem loading translations. Since I'm the creator, I speak Spanish, so I didn't see a problem leaving it like that. However, I'll fix it when I have time, as it seems to be a simple problem.

Also, to uninstall the browser, simply right-click "Uninstall Zen Browser" in the desktop environment applications menu on any distro. In environments like DDE, this doesn't seem to be implemented, but you can use the command mentioned below.

Using pyinstaller, you can create a binary containing the program and its necessary resources.

## Steps to compile a portable installer:
It requires the "BeautifulSoup" library to run. You can use the program directly with Python without compiling it, or you can compile it yourself if you wish:
pip install beautifulsoup4

# Generate .ts files
pylupdate5 zen-browser-start -ts resources/zn_en.ts resources/zn_pt.ts

# Edit translations with Qt Linguist (do it manually)
linguist resources/zn_en.ts resources/zn_pt.ts

# To compile all:
release resources/zn_*.ts

# Compile the program into a binary using pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "resources/logo.png:resources" --add-data "resources/zn_en.qm:resources" --add-data "resources/zn_pt.qm:resources" --icon=resources/logo.png zen-browser-start

## Uninstall all
Open your terminal and enter:
.local/share/zenbrowserstart/zen-browser-start --uninstallzenbrowser
for your user folder

or from, replacing "user" with the name of your user folder
/home/user/.local/share/zenbrowserstart/zen-browser-start --uninstallzenbrowser

## UI uninstall:
